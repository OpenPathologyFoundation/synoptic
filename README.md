# Synoptic  
*A project of the Open Pathology Foundation*  
**Advancing modular, AI-ready data structures for digital pathology and beyond**

---

### Overview  
**Synoptic** defines a modern, machine-readable data model for structured pathology reporting.  
It provides open, versioned schemas for encoding pathology “synoptic” data —  
the structured fields and logic that underpin tumor resections, biopsies, and diagnostic summaries.

The goal is to establish an interoperable foundation for:
- consistent, machine-verifiable data capture,  
- easy integration with laboratory systems and AI pipelines, and  
- vendor-neutral exchange of structured pathology data.

### Guiding Principles  
1. **Open by design** — transparent schemas, open-source tooling, public validation datasets.  
2. **Modular architecture** — each organ system (e.g., breast, colon, prostate) lives in its own versioned module.  
3. **Interoperable** — aligned with FHIR, JSON Schema, and other open standards.  
4. **Validated** — continuous integration verifies every schema and example through automated tests.  
5. **Clinically grounded** — built by and for pathologists, informaticians, and engineers.
