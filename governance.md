# Governance – Synoptic Project

The **Synoptic** project is maintained under the umbrella of the **Open Pathology Foundation**.

### Roles
- **Maintainers:** responsible for repository health, reviewing pull requests, and releases.  
- **Contributors:** any community member submitting code, schemas, or documentation.

### Decision Process
- Consensus-driven: changes are merged after public discussion and one maintainer approval.  
- In case of disagreement, maintainers may call for a vote or defer to the Foundation’s technical council.

### Versioning
- Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for each organ schema.  
- Tags use the format `<organ>@vX.Y.Z`.
